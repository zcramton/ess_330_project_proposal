    "Urban planning has existed for centuries out of necessity, historically dominated by efficiency and utilitarianism, optimizing the world we live in for profitability, corporate productivity, and automobile-based mobility. This optimization came with sacrifices, which now impact an increasingly large majority of the population. In recent years, the discipline has begun to prioritize human factors over utilitarian efficiency. Thousands of years of living in rural settings makes urban living hard for most people’s biology. Connection to nature and time outdoors even in small amounts has been shown to be a vital part maintaining physical and mental health \\[DOTHIS:: INSERT SOURCE HERE\\]. In an effort to make urban spaces more livable, planners are turning to parks and natural areas to connect people to nature."

    "2.  Create a recipe.\n",

    "4.  Create a workflow set including the previously written models and the recipe.\n",
    "5.  Map function over workflow using workflow map.\n",
    "6.  Using the highest performing model, fit the data and augment.\n",
    "7.  Plot and graph data to visually display test results.\n",
